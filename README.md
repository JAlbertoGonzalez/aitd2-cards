## Alone in the Dark 2 - Card Protection Script

Alone in the Dark 2 (1993) is an old PC videogame that runs on MS-DOS.

This game includes a copy protection based in a set of 6 cards with holes.

At the beggining of the game, a message will show up begging you to put one specific card over another specific card, and you must tell to the game what figure and color you can see placed in a determined hole.

Each card has a grid of 6x6, with 6 holes in it, and the rest are filled with poker figures.

There are 4 possible figures: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs.

There are 6 possible colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet and Orange.

Each card has 4 possible positions. They are identified by a header name (p.e. Ace of Hearts).
